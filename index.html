      <p>I have been working in the Banking industry for 10 years.  I have had many roles and my most recent was in the mortgage department.  I have decided to make a career change to becoming a full stack developer.  </p>

      <p>I was always interested in writing programs and saw this great opportunity in GW University Coding BootCamp and decided to enroll.  This has been the best decision I have ever made because I am learning so much.  I look forward to completing this course and using my new skills in my new career.</p>
